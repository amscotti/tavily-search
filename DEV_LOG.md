- Implemented logic to automatically extract content from top N search results
- Updated documentation to showcase the new feature
- Added new section in TODO list for Code Agent Features
- Tested combined search and extract functionality
- This feature is especially useful for code agents and AI assistants, enabling them to:
  - Search for relevant information
  - Extract detailed content from top results
  - All in a single command

## 2025-02-26: Output Clarity Enhancement

### Tasks Completed:
- Enhanced extraction output to include titles alongside URLs
- Modified the ExtractedContent struct to include an optional title field
- Implemented title tracking for search results that get extracted
- Improved the output formatting to clearly show which source each extracted content comes from
- Fixed warnings in the codebase
- This enhancement makes the output more useful for both users and code agents by:
  - Clearly associating extracted content with its source title
  - Making it easier to understand where information is coming from
  - Providing context for the extracted text

## 2025-02-26: User Experience Testing & Improvements

### Findings from Testing with LLM Agents:
- The tool successfully provided information outside of the LLM's knowledge cutoff (Angular v19 features)
- Combined search and extract functionality proved highly valuable for code agents
- AI-generated answers provided excellent summaries that helped guide further exploration

### Areas for Improvement Identified:
1. **Extracted content truncation**: The 300-character limit for extracted content is too restrictive for technical information
2. **Titles in extraction results**: Some sources lack proper titles, especially with complex layouts or paywalls
3. **AI answer usefulness**: AI-generated answers were consistently useful and could be the default behavior
4. **Content quality**: Some search results returned paywalled or partial content

### Next Improvement Steps:
- Increase the extract character limit for more comprehensive information
- Make AI-generated answers the default behavior with an option to disable
- Implement intelligent title parsing for extracted content when not provided by API
- These improvements will make the tool even more effective for both human users and code agents

### Items in Progress:
- [x] Increase extracted content length limit for more comprehensive information
- [ ] Make AI-generated answers the default behavior with option to disable
- [ ] Add intelligent title parsing for extracted content when not provided by API

## 2025-02-26: Extract Length Improvement

### Tasks Completed:
- Added `--extract-limit` parameter to control the length of extracted content (default: 800 characters)
- Updated the extraction output function to use the configurable limit
- Added the parameter to both search and extract commands
- Tested with different limit values to verify the functionality
- This improvement allows more comprehensive technical information to be displayed, especially important for code agents needing detailed context

## 2025-02-26: Unit Testing Implementation

### Tasks Completed:
- Created comprehensive test suite for the application:
  - Error handling tests
  - CLI argument parsing tests
  - ExtractedContent struct tests
  - TavilyClient initialization tests
  - Output formatting tests
- Implemented mocks for API responses and extracted content
- Fixed bugs discovered during test implementation
- Ensured all tests pass successfully
- This testing framework provides confidence in the core functionality and will help prevent regressions as we add new features

## 2025-02-26: CLI Best Practices Research

### Research Findings:
Used our own Tavily Search CLI tool to research best practices for Rust CLI applications, which yielded several key insights:

#### Documentation
- Use rustdoc comments (///) extensively for all public types and functions
- Create comprehensive README.md with example use cases
- Consider generating man pages using clap_mangen or help2man

#### User Feedback
- Implement progress indicators for long-running operations
- Use libraries like indicatif for progress bars and spinners
- Provide clear and transparent feedback about application status

#### Logging
- Use structured logging with the log crate
- Add environment variables to control verbosity and colored output
- Ensure logs tell a coherent story about the application's operations

#### Configuration
- Support both local and checked-in configuration files
- Use TOML for configuration formats
- Follow XDG base directory specification for config file locations

#### Cross-Platform
